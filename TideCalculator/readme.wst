     Dear TIDES user, 

     Here is a copy of the latest release of the tide and current 
     predicting program TIDES. 

     Read TIDES.DOC for details on the program and its operation. 

     This is a user supported shareware program for non-commercial use. If 
     you use it beyond a trial period the registration fee of $15 should be 
     paid. You are encouraged to copy and pass on the program without 
     alteration and without charge for trial use. 
   
     In order to make predictions for a specific location harmonic 
     constants for that place must have been entered in a ---.TID or ---
     .CUR data file. Local U.S. reference stations for which the National 
     Ocean Service (NOS) publishes tide tables and selected subordinate or 
     foreign stations are already on the disk and are listed in the file 
     STALIST.T&C. This list is displayed when the program is run. 
   
     Data files can be created with menu option H using either harmonic 
     constants or differences between the tides at a reference station and 
     at a subordinate station as given in Table 2 of the National Ocean 
     Service tide and tidal current tables. 
     
     Harmonic constant data for tides and currents for many other U.S. 
     stations are available. I will send the data for a few stations listed 
     in the U.S. tide or current tables for the east or west coasts to any 
     registered user who requests them. (Specify the latitude and longitude 
     to the nearest minute as well as the name of the location. Data for 
     the closest station will be provided.) TIDES.DOC gives instructions 
     for making data files using this data. The data can also be provided 
     on a customized disk. 

     Data for Canadian ports and limited data for other foreign ports is 
     also available and will also be provided on request to registered 
     users. Again specify the latitude and longitude of the station as well 
     as its name. Foreign data is of varying age, completeness and 
     accuracy.
   
     Please let me know if you have any problems, comments or suggestions.
