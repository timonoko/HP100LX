           (Note: Recent changes and additions are underlined)
   
     This is a program for predicting the height of the tide or the 
     strength of the tidal current at various stations. It runs on IBM 
     compatible machines under MS-DOS or IBM-DOS. The method and format 
     followed in the predictions are generally those used by the National 
     Ocean Service (NOS) in the standard tide and current tables. 
   
     This program may be freely copied and used for non-commercial 
     purposes. Feel free to try the program and pass it on without 
     alteration and without charge. If you use the program a $15 
     registration fee must be paid. 
     
     The author assumes no responsiblity for any errors in the program or 
     the predictions. 
   
     Detailed predictions are made for high and low water (or maximum ebb 
     and flood) at reference stations for which the tidal constants have 
     been derived from observations made over a long period of time. The 
     constants for subordinate stations are found by making corrections to 
     the constants at the reference stations. The predictions for 
     subordinate stations are less accurate than for reference stations, 
     particularly for the lower high and higher low water where tides are 
     nearly diurnal. Current floods/ebbs at subordinate stations may also 
     be less accurate. For stations where the current is rotary the current 
     along the principal axis is predicted. The times and speeds of flood 
     and ebb in these cases are approximate. 

     The TIDES program predicts the height of the tide or strength of the 
     current at any time. The values at reference stations are of the same 
     order of accuracy at any time as for the high/low or flood/ebb values. 
     The predictions for subordinate stations may be less accurate at 
     intermediate times, the more so the larger the differences from the 
     reference station 
                  
     PROGRAM OPERATION 

     Just enter TIDES and follow the prompts. When a date is to be input a 
     default date is displayed. It may be modified using the numerical keys
     and Home, End, left and right arrows and backspace. In general 
     entering "Q" or "Esc" will stop any operation and return you to the 
     menu. 

     A station filename may be entered on the command line after the 
     "TIDES" command. Any filename can include a valid PATH prefix. 

     Initially the start date is today and the end date is a week from 
     today. To run the next week's tides for the default station just enter 
     "A". 
   
     If the start date is earlier than 1582/10/15 the Julian calendar is 
     assumed, otherwise the Gregorian calendar is assumed. 
   
     The main menu gives options for:
     A - Computing and printing highs and lows
     B - Computing and printing hourly heights
     C - Plotting heights at a given interval (the default of 0.5 hours 
         generally works well)
     D - Computing the height at specified dates and times or intervals
     E, F & G - Changing the time interval, station, and default station
     H - Creating additional data files
     I - Changing from standard to daylight time or vice-versa 
         (In the U.S. Daylight Saving Time extends from 2 a.m. on the first 
          Sunday in April to 2 a.m. on the last Sunday in October)
     J - Changing from metric to English units or vice-versa
     K - For redirecting the printed output to a file or another printer
         (The output will be an ASCII file which can be edited using any text 
          editor) 
     L & M - Printing the astronomical and constituent factors used in the 
         predictions (used mainly for verifying the program)
     N - Shell to DOS without exiting TIDES
     O - Finding the extreme high, low and range in the time interval
     Q - Quitting TIDES
                                                             
     The equivalent quantities are computed for tidal currents. 
          
     When the "CHANGE STATION" or "CHANGE DEFAULT STATION" option is 
     executed a list of stations for which tidal constants have already 
     been stored in the TIDES format is shown, including the file names 
     under which they are kept. This is generally a selected set of 
     stations for a specific area.

     When the desired station is on the screen press S to stop paging. You 
     will then be prompted to enter the station file name which is shown in 
     parentheses after the station coordinates. 
                                                                            
     The list can be edited using EDLIN or any other text editing program. 
     For example undesired stations can be eliminated and other station 
     titles moved to the desired line. 
   
     The station names and locations stored in file STALIST.T&C are 
     displayed by the program as a reminder, but the name of any file of 
     data in the TIDES format can be used whether it is on the screen or 
     in the STALIST.T&C list or not. PATH prefixes can be used in the 
     filename. New stations for which no data file exists can be created 
     using menu option H. 
      
     CREATING ADDITIONAL DATA FILES 
   
     Option H is used to generate data files for the TIDES program both for 
     stations for which harmonic constants are available and for 
     subordinate stations, for which only differences from a reference 
     station are available. 
   
     First a title and file name for the station are entered. The prompt 
     for the title has places for the latitude and longitude of the station 
     which are optional inputs for better identification and do not affect 
     the computation. For stations for which harmonic constants are 
     available you are then prompted to enter the type of station (tide, 
     current, or hydraulic current) and the amplitude and epoch of each of 
     37 tidal constituents. The constants are entered in sequence from the 
     NOS form 444 of "Standard Harmonic Constants for Prediction", columns 
     B (?.??xH) and D (k'). If there is no data in column  B, use column H 
     (Amplitude). If the amplitude of a constituent is zero entering "0" or 
     just a carriage return will enter 0 for both the amplitude and epoch. 
     The modified epoch D (k') should be entered as a number from 0 to 360; 
     ignore any minus sign in column D. 

     Several minor constituents can optionally be inferred from the major 
     constituents if they are not entered directly. This generally gives a 
     slight improvement in accuracy at the cost of a slight increase in 
     running time. In places near an amphidromic point, such as New 
     Zealand, inferred constants are not helpful.

     For subordinate stations the corresponding reference station data must 
     exist in a data file. The list of stations for which data is already 
     stored is shown and the file name of the reference station entered. 
     The time differences between the reference and subordinate stations at 
     high and low (or maximum flood and ebb) are entered, then the height 
     differences. In some cases the range of the tide at both stations is 
     requested, as is the maximum flood and ebb for current stations. This 
     data can be taken from Table 2 of the NOS tide or current tables. 

     When Option H is run the title of the new station is added to the end 
     of the STALIST.T&C file. This file must be edited if it is desired to 
     place the station title in a different line. 

     REQUIREMENTS AND CHARACTERISTICS 
   
     TIDES should run on any IBM machine or compatible with 128K of free 
     memory and the text output should be OK on any printer. The plot of 
     tide heights on the monitor works on the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) 
     board and on the printer uses codes for the EPSON (IBM extended 
     ASCII.) Special codes to set up NEC pinwriter printers are also 
     available. TIDES.EXE, the executable version of the prediction 
     program, runs with or without an 80x87 coprocessor.
   
     TIDES computes the highs and lows for Boston for a month in about 1« 
     minutes on an IBM-XT with an 8087 coprocessor, and in about 38 minutes 
     without an 8087. (An 8087 coprocessor can be bought for less than $100 
     and is a good investment if you do much number crunching, such as 
     tidal predictions.) On a 486DX2-66 a years highs and lows for boston 
     took 22 seconds.

     Predictions for Boston and New York for 1986 agreed with the standard 
     tables to the minute and tenth of a foot for most cases with some 
     times off by 2 or 3 minutes and an occasional difference of .1 or .2  
     foot. Currents in Cape Cod Canal were generally within 0.1 knot. (If 
     the tide level remains nearly constant for an extended period the 
     predicted time of high or low can vary considerably but the height 
     will still be accurate.) 
   
     Predictions should be accurate for any era within a few centuries of 
     the present unless the physical conditions at the station change. 
  
     The source program TIDES.BAS is written in QuickBASIC. The source 
     code is available to registered users on request. 
   
     DATA SOURCES 

     A partial list of places for which I currently have harmonic constants 
     is given at the end of this document. 
      
     The harmonic constants for various North American reference stations 
     are published by: 
        National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration
        National Ocean Service N/OMA132
        Rockville, Maryland 20852 
   
     I have a complete set of this data for all U.S. reference stations 
     including Alaska, about 76 other U.S. stations and many stations in 
     British Columbia (see BCLIST.TXT for a list of the latter.) I will 
     send a copy of a limited number of station constants and subordinate 
     station corrections to registered users who let me know the area of 
     interest. The stations for which constants are available are listed 
     below. 
   
     Differences for tides and currents for subordinate U.S. locations are 
     given in the annual tables published by the National Ocean Service. In 
     1989 the datum to which height of tide is referred was changed from 
     mean low water to mean lower low water for all U.S. stations. Though 
     the difference is generally only a couple of tenths of a foot or less, 
     data should be taken from 1989 or later tables. The constants 
     themselves do not change appreciably over many years so any later 
     table can be used. 
     
     The International Hydrographic Organization maintains a data bank of 
     tidal constants for  4208 stations worldwide. If you wish constants 
     for foreign locations send me the latitudes and longitudes (to the 
     nearest minute) and I will eventually send the constants for the 
     closest station in the IHO data set if available. (The IHO data uses 
     the symbols H for amplitude and G for phase in place of k'.) 
   
     The tide tables published by the British Admiralty give data for use 
     in their Simplified Harmonic Method of Tidal Prediction. This data is 
     given for about 4400 tide and 148 current stations world-wide. A PC 
     program implementing this method is also distributed. Harmonic 
     constants are given for M2, S2, K1 and O1 as well as data from which 
     M4, M6, S4, S6, MS4, MSf, Sa and SSa can be computed. Predictions of 
     about the same accuracy can be made with TIDES if inferred constants 
     are included in the data file. 
   
     The French "Table des mare‚s des grands ports du monde" gives Z0, 
     Sa, Q1, O1, K1, N2, M2, S2, MN4, M4 and MS4 for 901 ports world-wide. 
     This data is from IHO sources and may not be up-to-date.
                                                      
     TIDAL THEORY
     
     The theory used in the TIDES program is given in: 

        Manual of Harmonic Analysis and Prediction of Tides
        Paul Schureman
        Coast and Geodetic Survey Special Publication No.98
        U.S. Gov't. Printing Office, Washington D.C. 1941
   
     This book has been reprinted recently and is available from NOS for 
     $3.50 postpaid. I have a few copies and can send one for my cost of 
     $3.50 + postage for 1« pounds ($1.48 in the U.S.)

     A supplement to this document, "Computer Applications to Tides in the 
     National Ocean Survey" is also available from NOS at no cost. 
   
     MISCELLANEOUS 
                                                                         
     The present version of the program does not give predictions of slack 
     water at current stations and for rotary currents the north and east 
     components of velocity must be predicted separately at hourly 
     intervals and combined vectorially by the user. If there is a demand 
     for these features I may get around to adding them sometime. 
 
     Starting in the 1989 tables the datum was changed to mean lower low 
     water for all U. S. ports, which meant a change of a few tenths of a 
     foot in Z0 (item 1, line 2 of -.TID data files) for ports on the 
     Atlantic coast. The new values (or close approximations) have been 
     used in the data on this disk. 
   
     If you have any suggestions, comments or problems please let me know.
