==========================================
Desk Accessories (Terminate & Stay-Resident):
  Flight Simulator does not support the use of desk accessories such
  as Sidekick and Fansi Console (both registered Trademarks).  Be sure
  to shut down these applications before running Flight Simulator.
==========================================
PS/2 (Models 25 and 30) users:
  Select display option J (256 color, 320x200)
==========================================
EGA Graphics Card users:
  Minimum EGA card memory requirement:  256K
==========================================
Gas Plasma & LCD users:
  Gas Plasma users should select display option B (Black/White CGA)
  LCD users should select display option D (Liquid Crystal Display)
==========================================
Hercules display users:
  On some systems containing both a Hercules-compatible graphic board and
  a CGA-compatible board, the Hercules display option functions improperly.
  If you have this problem on your system, and you wish to run in the
  Hercules mode, you must remove the CGA board. If you are running in CGA
  mode, you should have no problem.
==========================================
Joystick & Yoke users:
  Some game cards have external switches for fine-tuning. If you have
  such a card, experiment with the settings until sound quality is best.
==========================================
Installing on a hard disk from a 3.5-inch floppy disk:
  Flight Simulator is stored in the \FLSIM subdirectory on the 3.5" disk.
  1.  Follow steps 1 through 6 in "Installing Flight Simulator on your
       Hard Disk" on page xiv of your Flight Simulator manual.
  2.  Type  copy a:\flsim\*.*  and press ENTER to copy all Flight Simulator
       files from the floppy disk to the hard disk.
==========================================
Copying to a 1.2-Meg 5.25-inch floppy disk:
  Flight Simulator can be copied to a 1.2-meg floppy disk for backup, or
  to avoid switching disks.
  1. Insert a blank, formatted 1.2-meg floppy disk in drive A:.
  2. Type  a:  and press ENTER to change to floppy drive A:.
  3. Type  md flsim  and press ENTER to make a directory for Flight
       Simulator.
  4. Type  cd flsim  and press ENTER to change directories.
  5. Insert one of the Flight Simulator disks in floppy drive B:.
  6. Type  copy b:*.* a:  and press ENTER to copy all Flight Simulator
       files from the floppy disk in drive B: to the floppy disk in
       drive A:.
  7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for the second Flight Simulator disk.
==========================================
Laptop Keyboards:
  Some keyboard functions may not be available on laptop keyboards, al-
  thought you can access all functions through menus.  With the NUM LOCK
  key, some alpha/numeric keys assume the layout of the 10-key numeric
  keypad, and operate view selection and airplane controls.  In "standard"
  keyboard mode, the keys correspond to the alphabetic assignments (e.g.
  pause or strobe on and off).  Pressing NUM LOCK turns on the map view,
  and activates the keypad mode.  If you press NUM LOCK twice rapidly, you
  turn off the map while retaining the keypad mode.
==========================================
Selecting the Active Window:
  You can have multiple windows, as described on page 27 in the manual.
  To make a window active, choose the [-key for 3-D window one; the ]-key
  for 3-D window two; and the NUM LOCK key for the map window; followed
  by the apostrophe key (') to bring that window to the front.
==========================================
Entertainment Functions:
  Always exit entertainment (Crop Duster, WWI-Ace, Formation Flying,
  Multi-Player) and Flight Instruction by choosing Normal Flying,
  Flight Instruction, or another Entertainment function from the MODE
  menu.  DO NOT use Option B (Mode Select) from the MODE menu to resume
  Normal Flying, as this will only change your location and aircraft
  simulation and control settings.
==========================================
Choosing Aircraft:
  You can run the entertainment functions (World War I, Crop Duster,
  Formation Flying) using any plane.  The World War I game is designed
  to be used with the SOPWITH; Crop Duster, Flight Lessons, & Formation
  Flying are designed to be used with the CESSNA. Results with other
  planes may be less than optimal, but are allowed so you can experience
  the environments in different aircraft.
==========================================
Formation Flying:
  If you crash, the lead plane will not crash with you!!  If you want to
  rerun the game, reselect Formation Flying (MODE menu, Option 5, Enter-
  tainment, Option 2, Formation Flying) and choose the desired course.
==========================================
Starting the Demo:
  If you choose DEMO mode from the startup screen (with or without sound),
  your mouse is disabled.  If you want to use the mouse and fly in Normal,
  Entertainment, or Lesson modes [after the demo is run]; you should start
  Flight Simulator in "Normal Flight Mode" (Option B from the startup menu)
  and select the demo from within the program (MODE menu, Option 6).
==========================================
Lights:
  You will only see the strobe effect when in clouds (especially at night).
  The marker lights and strobe are not seen from external aircraft views.


N E W     F E A T U R E S
==========================================
Flight Lesson Sequencing:
  If you want to automatically run the lessons one after another, choose
  option Y, Lesson Sequencing, in the Flight Instruction menu. If you
  select Instructor Mode (Option X), lesson #1 runs the Instructor mode then
  the Student mode, then lesson #2 begins in Instructor mode.  If you
  select Student Mode, the instructor demonstrations will not be seen and
  lesson #2 student mode follows lesson #1 student mode. Select the first
  lesson you want to run to start the sequence.
==========================================
Smooth panning:
  Press ENTER or SHIFT+ENTER to pan downward and SHIFT+BACKSPACE to pan
  upward. Press the view control key (Scroll Lock on IBM PC with function
  keys on left, keypad * for IBM PC with function keys on top, BREAK on
  Tandy) to return to a level view.

  Sideways smooth panning is available on the Tandy 1000 with the LEFT and
  RIGHT arrow keys. Press the LEFT arrow key to pan left and the RIGHT
  arrow key to pan right.  The Tandy 1000 Quick Reference card says to
  use Backspace to pan upward.  The Backspace key restores a zoomed
  window to 1x. Use Shift+Backspace as described above.
==========================================
Exiting Demos & Instructor Lessons:
  Press ESC to stop demo playback or Flight Lessons (Instructor mode).
  All other keypresses (except CTRL+BREAK) are ignored.
==========================================
Display Quality:
  Display Quality is a new option (option E) on the Views menu.  Option 1
  on the Display Quality menu allows you to choose the flicker rate and
  speed. Flicker rate determines how often multiple windows are repainted.
  Speed is how often the scenery is repainted.  The best flicker quality is
  at the expense of scenery speed; and vice versa.  Image Complexity,
  option 2, is a planned enhancement for the quality of scenery display,
  and is not implemented in version 3.0.
==========================================
ADF Information:
  The following Non Directional Beacons (NDB's) can be tuned with the
  ADF radio.

==========================================
Loadable scenery files:
  You can now convert your older SubLOGIC scenery disks into the version
  3.0 format, and load them into your Flight Simulator subdirectory.
   1. At the system prompt, type  converts  and press ENTER.
   2. At the prompt, insert your SubLOGIC scenery disk into the disk
      drive, then type that drive's letter.
   3. A list of all possible scenery disks will appear on your screen.
      At the prompt, type the letter corresponding to the scenery disk
      you are converting.
   4. At the prompt, type the letter of the drive where you want the
      scenery stored.

  The scenery filename will be SD-*.SCN, with the * replaced by the num-
  bers 1 through 12, or JPN, SFS, or EUR. The files generated by "converts"
  are placed in the default subdirectory on the drive you indicated. Only
  these new scenery files are scanned for "automatic scenery loading".

  Option A, Automatic Scenery Loading, appears on the Scenery Library
  menu (choose NAV/COM then Option 2, Scenery Load) only if there are
  two or more converted scenery files in the Flight Simulator subdirectory.
  If Option A is selected, and a scenery file is available for the area
  in which you are flying, that scenery file is automatically loaded and
  used while you fly within its boundaries.

  Crash detection (choose SIM, then Option 2) should be set to "Off"
  when changing to other scenery disks.  Once you have started flying at
  the new location, Crash detection can be turned "On".
==========================================
Demo Recording:
  The (#) sec message at the bottom of the screen indicates the recording
  interval currently set in the Demo Recorder menu (Option D).

  airplane for your viewing, not the color of your airplane as stated in
  the manual.
==========================================
"Squawk" code and Transponder:
  Air Traffic Control (ATC) does not request a squawk code, as stated in
  the manual on page 39; but the transponder can be tuned as described.
