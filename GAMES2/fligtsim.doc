                  Thrown together by Bill Landreth
              during the month of May in the year 1985


           Dedicated to the poor souls who do not like to
           use their manuals because they are not on a CRT.



    Firstly, it should be noted that the newer versions of MS Filght
Simulator can be started in two ways.  These are either booting up the
main disk or inserting the main disk while in DOS and starting the file
"FS.COM" (note that the file FS.COM appears on the protected disk, and
should be under the default drive).  The reason that Microsoft allows us
lowly people to start something in such a difficult mannor is because
this mode of startup allows you to install a mouse-driver if you wish --
to use the mouse for input.  Rumor has it that this will allow other types
of drivers to be installed before starting Flight Simulator, but in my
brief attempt to try this I failed. (for the curious, I tried to load
a driver for my Tecmar Graphics Master, but the driver was blowed up.)

    Next, you should be aware of the fact that by hitting <escape> you
will be presented with a screenfull (one of two) of options to change if
you do not find the present situation to your liking.  You may then hit
<return> to go down to the next option, hit "-" to go up to the previous,
or enter a number to change the current option.  After entering a new
argument to a parameter it may be entered with either the <return> or
the "-" keys.  The option page will automatically switch to the second
page (or first, if on page two already) if you move either off the top or
bottom of the screen. Here are the parameters explained:
                            *************

User Mode           :Selects a "mode;" a place to store sets of parameters.
                       MODES 0-9 ARE PRE-DEFINED, MODES 10-19 ARE ASSUMED TO
                       BE USER-MODIFIED VERSIONS OF 0-9 WITH 10 ADDED (i.e.,
                       mode 0 becomes mode 10 when user-modified, mode 5
                       becomes 15, etc). MODES 20-29 ARE USER DEFINED.

Sound               :1=Sound on, 0=Sound off. With no sound, watch out for
                       stalls!!  If sound on, you will beeps when stalling.

Auto-Coordination   :1=linked rudders and ailerons (the easy choice!)
                       0=You must controll rudders and ailerons separately

Slew                :1=Slew system ON         (covered
                       0=Slew system OFF         later)

Reality Mode        :0=You don't have to worry about the little things,
                       like burned out lights or iced-over engines.
                       1=Reality in effect, watch out!

Demo Mode           :1=Demo takes over

Europe 1917         :Setting this to one is the same as setting "User Mode"
                       to 7.  You CANNOT change the World War One battle game
                       mode - it will always remain user mode 7.

Communication Rate  :From 1 to 255, how fast the "radio" sends text across
                       the screen. 1 is slow, 255 is fast -- the best values
                       to pick are powers of two for smooth scrolling.

North Position      :2-byte value showing your north position in 256 meter
                       units...has your current position on entry.

East Position       :Ditto for the East

Altitude            :Sets/displays current altitude

Pitch               :Sets/displays current pitch (0-359)

Bank                :Sets/displays current bank (0-359)

Heading             :Sets/displays current heading (0-359)

Airspeed            :Sets/displays current airspeed in knots

Throttle            :Sets/displays current throttle setting

Rudder              :Sets/displays current rudder setting

Ailerons            :Sets/displays current aileron setting

Flaps               :(yawn)Sets/displays current flap setting

Elevators           :Sets/displays current elevator setting

Hours               :Allows viewing or changing of local hour, 0-23
                         (hows that for a change?)
Minutes             :Sets/displays current minutes (0-59)
                         (now we're back in the rut again!)

Season              :1=Winter, 2=Spring, 3=Summer, 4=Fall

Cloud Layers        :Allows setting of 2 cloud layers, tops and bottoms.

Wind                :Allows setting of 3 wind layers, wind layer one
                       starts at ground level and stops at "Shear Zone
                       altitude 1" and wind layer two picks up from there.

Reliability Factor  :0 to 100% reliable while "Reality mode" is set. Has
                       no effect if reality mode off, but if on then a low
                       value assures problems while a high value makes
                       problems more unlikely.

Joystick            :0=no joystick, 1=one joystick, 2=two joysticks
                            ***************

  }} IMPORTANT NOTE:  You MUST hit the <insert> key after changing any
     parameters or any changes will be lost when you exit.  You exit,

    Now that the editor is all out of the way, you may be interested in
finding out what some of those dials and jing-a-ma-deals are that take up
half of your screen.  Here is a description of them:

Dial, Far left with "KNOTS" writen on it:
   --+ This dial relates the airspeed of the craft to the viewer in knots

Jing-a-ma-deal, Far left with "L" and "R."  Directly under the "Knots" dial:
   --+ This thing is a "turn co-ordinator." It's degree of tilt shows how
      fast you are turning, and if it just touches the "L" or "R" this means
      that a 2-minute turn is in progress; that is in two minutes a 360 will
      have taken place.  Little circle under it -- yes the one in the box --
      shows the relationship between the plane's longitudinal axis and
      direction of flight. It is WAY off if you fly sideways, for instance.

Just to the right of the "KNOTS" dial, half dark half light:
   --+ This is an artificial horizon.  If you've ever seen an airplane
      movie, you know what it is. Otherwise, your oudda luck.

Below the richly described artificial horizon, 3 numbers over a plane:
   --+ This be a compass, displaying 0 to 359.  The little "D" near the
      compass is to tell you that you may hit "D" to coordinate your
      plane's compass with a magnetic one. A magnetic one does not "drift,"
      but takes a long time to settle so you have a gyro. (lucky, eh?)

Two the right of the now infamous artificial horizon:
   --+ A dead givaway of an altimiter. Large hand is hundreds, small hand
      is thousands, and there is yet a smaller hand for tens of thousands
      when you get that high. You may hit "A" to adjust this dial to the
      real world, as with the directional gyro (compass).

To the right of the compass, the next dial over. Word "UP" appears:
   --+ This shows rate of climb/dive in foot-per-second, up is climb.

Between compass and rate of climb dial, 2 horizontal lines and a vertical:
   --+ Shows the current Aileron (top), elevator (middle), and rudder
      (bottom) settings. When in coordinated mode, top and bottom are
      always the same.

The two far right circles, near altimiter and rate of climb:
   --+ Your two Omni-Bearing indicators with glidescope(?). Forget about
      this one, your life is complicated enough. (or is it my life that's
      complicated enough??)

The three vertical bars to the right of the two circles above:
   --+ The top one shows your flaps, the middle shows elevator trim, the
      bottom indicates throttle setting. The "C.H." that may or may not
      be under the throttle setting indicated "Carburetor Heat."

3-digits labeled "compass":
   --+ Your magnetic compass. Jinx, you owe me a Coke. The new kind, too.

2 dials marked "fuel":
   --+ Left- and right-wing fuel tank indicators.

2 dials under fuel gauges, marked "OIL T" and "OIL P":
   --+ Shows oil temperature and oil pressure

3 lights under compass marked O,M, and I:
   --+ O,M, and I stand for Outer, Middle and Inner. Will light up when
      you are over one of the marker beacons for instrument approach.

Under O-M-I lights, 5 digits marked "COM":
   --+ Shows the frequency that your communications radio is tuned to.

To the right of the COM indicator, group of 3 words:
   --+ Top: Landing gear, up or down (shown as "DN").  Middle: Lights,
      on or off.  Bottom: Engine ignition coils, on or off.

The NAV 1, NAV 2, and DME indicators:
   --+ Nav 1 and 2 will show the current frequency of those things I told
      you to forget all about. DME tells how far away from the NAV 1
      source you are in miles. (sorry I mentioned it)

To the right of NAV 2, 4 digits marked XPNDR:
   --+ Lets you know what squawk you send to Air Traffic Control as an
   identification. Known as a "Transponder" in the big city.

Bottom two indicators to the far left, marked TIME and RPM:
   --+ One of the two is a clock, the other is a tachometer.  I seem to
      have forgotten which is which.



    Once you know all those by heart I suppose you will want to know how
to FLY the dang thing. Well, here are the keyboard commands:

                         The Keypad:


0       :     Controls the rudder to the left, in coordinated mode also
          controls ailerons.
1       :     Nose up trimmer.  Slight adjustment to the elevators.
2       :     Nose up. Elevators up one notch.
3       :     I forget what this one does. oops. If anything at all...
4       :     Bank left - Ailerons left, when coordinates mode is on this
          also controls the rudders.
5       :     Centers ailerons and rudders.
6       :     Bank right - Ailerons right, when coordinated mode is in
          effect this also controls rudders.
7       :     Nose down trimmer.  Slight down adjustment to elevators.
8       :     Nose down.  Elevators down a notch.
9       :     The opposite of key three, I think. maybe. or maybe not.
NumLock :     Activates the radar view.  HIT "+" OR "-" ON MAIN KEYBOARD
          TO ZOOM IN AND OUT. DO NOT USE KEYPAD "+" AND "-" TO ZOOM.
                      ('cause it won't work!)
Scroll- :     If in "Radar" mode, activates "visual" mode. If in "visual"
Lock      mode, follow Scroll-Lock with one of the 9 keypad keys to look
          in that direction...i.e. hit scroll-lock and "2" on the keypad
          and you will be looking out the back of the plane.

                              The Function Keys

F1,F3,F5,F7,F9   :  This set of keys controls the 5 possible settings for
                  your planes flaps; F1=0 degrees and F9=50 degrees.

F2,F4,F6,F8,F10  :  These keys are your throttle control. F2 is throttle
                  full, F10 is cut throttle. F4 increases throttle two
                  notches while F8 decreases throttle 2 notches. F6 raises
                  the throttle one notch. There are 32 "notches."


                             The Number Strip
                      (accross top of  main keyboard)
                        -=PRESS "M" BEFORE 0 TO 9=-

          numbers marked with "??" may do something, but I forgot.

1  -  Magnetos off       2  -  Left Magneto on     3  -  Right Magneto on
4  -  Both Magnetos on   5  -  Start engine        6  -  ??
7  -  ??                 8  -  ??                  9  -  ??
0  -  Full lean fuel     -  -  Radar zoom out      +  Radar zoom in
                                    or                     or

                           The Main Keyboard

A = Altimeter adjustment.
C = Tunes communications radio. Hit "+" or "-" after hitting "C" to tune
   radio, hit "C" again TWICE to tune the decimal points.
D = Directional gyro adjustment.
G = Toggle landing gear up/down.
H = Carburetor heat on/off. Used to keep engine from icing.
L = Lights on/off. Toggle outside and instrument lights.
N = Tunes Nav-1 or Nav-2.  Hit "1" or "2" after "N" to select, and then
   "+" or "-" to tune. To tune in smaller incriments hit "N" twice before
   selecting "1" or "2."
T = Sets transponder. Hit "T" to change first number with "+" and "-",
   "TT" for second, "TTT" for third, and "TTTT" for forth.
V = Tunes OBI. Hit "V" followed by "1" or "2" for OBI number and then
   "+" or "-" to tune to VOR station.
. = Brakes. For use when on ground (surprise!).

                               Slew Mode
                   }} Selectable from parameter menu {{

     The slew-subsystem allows you to "fly" without really flying.  You
can, for instance, slowly drift backward while upside-down if you really
want to....or you can scream accross the void, getting from L.A. to N.Y.
in 3 minutes. After selecting "Slew" from the options menu (hit escape)
you are in slew mode (don't forget to hit the <insert> key first!!).
     Once in slew mode, use function keys F1,F3,F5,F7, and F9 to control
your plane's pitch and function keys F2,F4,F6,F8, and F10 to control your
plane's altitude. The more you hit "F2," the faster you go up, and you
go STRAIGHT up. Use the <alt> key to reset pitch, heading, and bank to
zero degrees. You can use the "T" key at any time to transfer your current
altitute, bank, pitch and heading to the current mode.
     The keypad keys 7 and 9 control your bank slew, while 1 and 3 control
your heading slew.  8,2,4, and 6 (up, down, left and right) control north,
south, west, and east movements. The keypad key "5" will essentially stop
all movement. Hitting any of these keys multiple times (except <alt>, "5,"
and "T") will increase their effects.  One tap on the keypad "6" will send
you drifting very slowly to the east, but several taps will move you faster
and faster.

     The world war I ace game included with Flight Simulator should not
be attempted unless you are quite sure that you can handle the basics
of flying. Once you are ready to try, you will notice a few differences
between this mode and the modern mode.

  1  :  More simple plane.  Fewer things to worry about such as radios
       and landing gear and whatnot.
  2  :  Now a simple radar screen appears on the lower-right hand corner
       of the screen.
  3  :  If you hit "R" you get a "War Report."
  4  :  If you hit "W" war is declared.
  5  :  If you hit "X" bombs drop.
  6  :  Spacebar fires machine guns.

  You can scout enemy land (it's over the river) without declaring war,
to get an idea as to what to bomb and where the enemy planes come from.
the radar on the main ("visual mode") screen will show a red (orange)
blip if an enemy is below you, a white (white) blip if he is within +-
100 feet of you in height, or a green (blue) blip if he is above you
on RGB (composite) monitors. The radar will ONLY WORK WHEN FORWARD
VISUAL VIEW IS SELECTED.


    Please feel free to pass this on to other people who may be in need
of it.  If you think of anything that needs to be added, do not hesitate
to add away and of course corrections to my grammer and/or spelling are
almost certainly a must!
