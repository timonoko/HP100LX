How to play Dominoes ---------------------------

In the game of Dominoes, each player takes turn placing 
domino tiles end-to-end. One end of the domino played 
must match the outside end of the last domino, so that 
the two matching ends are together. Doubles, however, 
are played sideways. The first double played is called 
the "spinner", and after both sides have been played to, 
its ends can be played as well.

Scoring:
After each play, the outside ends of the last dominoes 
are added, and if the total is a multiple of five, then 
the person who played last scores that many points. If 
a double is the last tile in an arm, then it is played 
sideways and both of its ends count towards the total. 
If dominoes have been played off the spinner, then the 
last domino in each of those arms is scored too.

If a player can't play with a domino in his hand, he 
must draw a tile from the "Bone Yard", where the 
leftover dominoes are kept, until he draws one that he 
can play. A player is not allowed to draw unless he must 
to be able to play.

When a player plays his last domino, he gets to score 
the total of the spots in his opponent's hand, rounded 
to the nearest five. If both players still have dominoes 
and the Bone Yard has been emptied, and neither can 
play, then the game is blocked. Both players then count 
the total spots in their hands, and the person with the 
fewest gets to score the points in his opponent's hand, 
rounded to the nearest five. All scores are multiples of 
five because the score is traditionally kept with one 
mark on the paper being five points.

A game is 250 points. Multiple hands will be played 
until one player scores at least 250, then the game is 
over immediately.

Strategy ----------------------

The strategy of dominoes can be broken down into three 
categories:
1. Scoring
2. Preventing your opponent from scoring
3. Blocking
These are listed in order of increasing difficulty, and 
therefore are charactersitics of domino players of 
increasing ability.

Scoring:
You can more quickly and easily figure if you will be 
able to score on a play by looking at the points on the 
board before you play, and figuring the difference 
between what's there and what it will need to score. 
For example, if there are currently 17 points, then you 
can make it a multiple of five and therefore score by 
taking away two, or by adding three. Then look for 
dominoes in your hand that can do this. There are 
certain "magic" dominoes which you should try to hold on 
to because they make scoring easier. If your opponent 
has just scored, then you won't be able to score without 
one of these, and if you score, it then makes it more 
difficult for your opponent to score. These dominoes are 
the 0-0, 0-5, 5-5, and 6-1. If you opponent scores with 
a blank, five, or a non-double six or one on an end, 
then you would also be able to score with one of these.
Other magic dominoes can score when there is a double 
on an end. These are the 1-2, 2-4, and 3-6, which can 
duplicate the points in a 1-1, 2-2, and 3-3. Other magic 
dominoes are the 3-1, 4-3, and 6-2, which will score 
five or ten fewer points after a 3-3, 4-4, and 6-6, 
respectively.

Preventing your opponent from scoring:
After you get good at finding scoring tiles in your 
hand, you will be able to start looking for potential 
scoring plays that your opponent could make, and play 
ones from your hand that give him the least opportunity.

Blocking
The simplest form of blocking is achieved by noticing 
when your opponent is forced to draw from the Bone Yard, 
and making a mental note of which numbers he could have 
played to. Then, try to make those numbers his only 
options again. You can also consider that if you have 
several of one number, or if several have already been 
played, your opponent is more likely to be out of them.

Another strategy related to blocking, is to use you low 
dominoes to try to force the low dominoes out of your 
opponents hand, then when you go out, he will have more 
points left in his hand. Try to remember to use your 
larger dominoes for scoring, and your smaller ones for 
blocking.

How to Play Dominoes on the Palmtop ------------------

The controls for playing the game have intentionally 
been kept simple. Your hand appears at the bottom of 
the screen, with each tile aligned with one of the 
Palmtop's function keys. If you ever have more than ten 
tiles, some will be drawn one row up, and are played by 
hitting shift-function key.  Note: if you have defined
the shift-function keys to start certain applications on
the palmtop, you can instead hit the "S" key before the
function key to play one from the second row.

On the left side of the screen is the title box, showing 
how many tiles your opponent has in his hand, and how 
many are in the boneyard. Next are the computer's score, 
followed by your score, and finally the count of the end 
tiles currently on the table.

The rest of the screen is used as the table for playing. 
There is not enough room on this table to allow them all 
to be played without hitting an edge, so when one of the 
arms reaches an edge, it will bend around. Remember to 
look at the last one played in each arm, not simply 
which is farthest from the center. If one arm gets 
crowded in a corner, it will automatically re-arrange 
the tiles to fit better. If you would like them 
re-arranged at any time, hit the "R" key.

When it's your turn, simply hit the function key 
corresponding to the domino you want to play. If there 
is only one place for this domino to be played, or if 
there is no difference between multiple places, the 
domino will jump to that spot. If there is more than one 
way to play it, a small box will appear asking which 
direction (from the spinner) you want; hit one of the 
arrow keys to make your choice. This is the direction of 
that arm from the spinner, not necessarily the direction 
that arm may currently be headed if they have been bent 
around an edge.

To switch between expert and beginner levels, you can use
any of the "L", "B" or "E" keys.

To see what domino the computer would suggest that you
play, hit the "?" (shift-3) key, or just the "3" key. 
The domino will flash, then the place to play it will 
flash.

If you have some dominoes on the second row, and some
empty spaces on the first row, you can hit the "P" key
to pack all the dominoes into the first spaces.

If you want to rearrange the dominoes in your hand, 
such as to sort the numbers in order, use the "M" key
(for "Move").

Anytime you want to quit the game, hit the "Q" key.

Tips for Running Dominoes on the Palmtop -------------

Dominoes is a DOS program which is written only for the 
HP 100LX and 200LX Palmtops. DOS applications can be run 
at the same time as the other System Manager Compliant 
applications, but you may have only one DOS program 
running at a time. You may switch to another app by 
hitting its blue key just as you always do. To get back, 
you can either start DOS from App Manager, or hit 
Ctrl-123. You can't just go to App Manager and ask it to 
start Dominoes again.

Dominoes can be run by opening the filer application, 
moving the cursor to the DOMINOES.EXE file, and hitting 
Enter. The easier way is to install it into your App 
Manager:

1. Start App Manager by hitting the blue "More" key.
2. Hit F2 to add an icon.
3. Enter the name you would like to appear for the 
   program in the Name field, then Tab to the next field.
4. In the Path field, type in the full path name of the 
   exe file, including the .exe extension, then add the 
   "|" (shift-backslash) character, and 70, like this:
     Path: c:\games\dominoes.exe|70
   The 70 tells app manager to give the program 70K of 
   memory to run in.  If your palmtop tells you that 
   there is not enough memory, increase this number.
5. In the comments line you can put a "¨" character 
   (upside-down question mark, Fn-3) to have it skip 
   the "press any key..." message when Dominoes exits.
6. Tab to the Icon area and select an icon. Then hit 
   F10.

This program will not work on a regular DOS PC.  It
will actually be running, but there will be no graphics
to show you what is going on.  Hit the "Q" key to quit.
The graphics used are specific to the palmtop.


Revision History -----------------------------
This is version 2.2.

Version 2.2 fixed some bugs in 2.0, and adds a show if
you win the game.

The new features for version 2.0 are:
* The game is automatically saved when you exit, so that
  next time you start, you'll be in the same place.
* The score bar graph moves 5 points at a time.  This is
  so that you will be more likely to notice when a score
  is made.
* The score bar shows points scored this hand in a grayed
  pattern, and the score made in previous hands is solid
  black.  Now you can get a trend for who is catching up.
* You can now hit the "?" key, or the unshifted "3" key
  to see the computer's suggestion, and the suggested
  place to play it shows up better.

The features new to version 1.8 were:
* Use the "M" key to move the dominoes in your hand, so
  you can sort them how you like.
* Use the "P" key to pack your hand.  This will move all
  of them into the first empty spaces.  Use this if you
  have had to draw onto the second row of dominoes, and
  you want to move them all onto the first row.
* Use the "?" (shift-3) key to have the computer 
  suggest what you should play.  The suggested domino
  will flash, then the place to play it will flash.
