JAMMED 1.0 - Shareware strategy game for HP100/200LX
----------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS JAMMED?

A virus has infected your body. But, don't worry: you have strong
antibodies. However, you have to show these antibodies where the
virus is. This is not really a problem for you since you have the overview
and see where the antibody is (star shaped character) and where the virus
is (hexagonal shape). However, the way from the antibody to the virus is
jammed with blood clots, so you cannot just walk the antibody to the virus.
You have to shift around the blood clots in order to free the way. Doing that
needs energy. When all energy is used up, the game is over (for that
antibody - not for your body since you have millions of antibodies :-)

If you think this is not realistic at all: you are right! If you want
to be right, just try to move the star shaped piece towards the hexagonal
piece and shift the rectangular blocks around to free the way :-)


HOW TO INSTALL?

Copy JAMMED.EXE to your HP100/200LX. That's all. To run JAMMED, just type
JAMMED and press ENTER at the DOS prompt. You also can select JAMMED.EXE
in FILER and press ENTER.


HOW TO PLAY?

When starting JAMMED, it shows you the welcome screen. From there, you
can access the menu by pressing the Menu key. Some of the menu items you
can also access by the function keys. The following menus are available:

Game Menu:

   New Game (F2) - starts a new game (didn't you expect that? ;-)
   Restart Level (F3) - lets you play the last played level again
   Restart Game - lets you play the last played game again
   Start Game by Number - lets you specify which game you want to play
      (Each game has a number. There are 65535 different games. The game
      number is displayed while playing and also stored in the high scores
      list.)
   Abort game (F4) - lets you abort the current game if you see there is no
      chance to complete it (e.g. not enough energy left)
   Show High Scores (F5) - displays the highest scores achieved do far
   Exit (F10) - exits JAMMED

Quit Menu:

   Exits JAMMED

Help menu:

   How to Play (F1) - displays a short summary of the game
   How to Register - displays registration information

Once you have started a game, you will see a rectangular grid and status
information to the right of the grid. Within the grid you will notice a 
star shaped piece (this is the antibody) and a hexagonal piece (the virus).
The rest of the grid is partly empty and partly filled with rectangular
blocks. These blocks are the blood clots.

The antibody starts somewhere near the upper left corner of the grid while
the virus is located somewhere near the lower right corner. You can move
the antibody by pressing the arrow keys (cursor keys). If you try to move
the antibody to a filled field, the blood clot in that field and all blood
clots connected to it are shifted. This only works when no blood clot has
to be pushed against a wall.

Sometimes, it is not possible to get to the virus since the way is barred
and it is not possible to push the blood clots to free the way. In these
cases you can push the Del or the Space key to tell the antibody it should
eat the blood clots in the eight fields surrounding it.

Once you have moved the antibody to the virus, the virus is eliminated
and a new level starts. (Did you think the infection will be stopped by
eliminating just ONE virus? ;-)


THE SCORES

If you had unlimited energy, the game would continue forever (or until you
eliminated all viruses, but there are MANY!). But, as it is in real life,
you have only limited energy. When you start the game, you have 80 energy
points. Each move of the antibody needs one energy point. When you shift
around blood clots while moving, this needs additional two energy points.
Finally, if the antibody has to swallow the surrounding blood clots, this
is a lot of work and costs 20 energy points.

Whenever you complete a level (i.e. eliminate the virus), you get an award
of 50 energy points. On the way to the virus to be eliminated there are
sometimes 'minor' viruses that are not really dangerous. However, for each
of them the antibody devours, 10 energy points are rewarded.

The game ends if all energy is used up.

All energy points that you did not use when completing a level are added
to the score. Thus, the less energy you use, the higher will get your
score.


WHY REGISTER?

1) Because it is unfair to play without registering.
2) Because you want to support the shareware concept.
3) Because you want to get past level 5.
4) Because the high scores are saved across sessions.


HOW TO REGISTER?

The most easy way to register JAMMED is to use GO SWREG on CompuServe.
Just do a GO SWREG, select ID 4135 and answer the questions. A few
days later, you will receive your registration information by email.
An amount of $20 will be charged to your CompuServe bill.

If you do not have access to CompuServe, put $20 into an envelope
and send it together with your email address (preferably) or your
snail mail address (only if not possible otherwise) to:

   Andreas Garzotto
   Buttenaustr.18
   8134 Adliswil
   Switzerland

A few days later you will get your registration instructions by email
(or a quite a few weeks later by snail mail).

The registration will be valid for future versions of JAMMED too.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I want to thank Harry Konstas who provided HPCLIB. HPCLIB is a C library
of functions that allow to build a user interface similar to the HP built-in
applications.

I want to thank Fred Kaufman and Harry Konstas for beta testing JAMMED.

And finally, I want to thank the virus that infected me and made it possible
to program JAMMED since I could stay at home a few days, trying to get rid of
the flu.
