		An Astronavigation program complete with

			built-in almanac for 1950 - 2050
			reduction of sights
			graphical displays of the stars
			world map


		It works, but a SatNav system is simpler and wiser !

		 DISCLAIMER

    I have taken every effort to ensure that the data used is accurate
    and that my formulae are correct.

    However there may be inaccurate data or totally wrong code. I am not
    qualified in any way to judge. I know that there are inherent weaknesses
    in my reductions of the planets and main star data.

    I have used the program to compute my position on many occasions, and it
    seems to work. This does not mean it will continue to work. Do try using
    the program and then working the sight out with an almanac. You need to
    be able to use the Almanac when this program does not work, or your
    computer gets wet.

    If you are prepared to accept this program as it is, with all its faults,
    then do use it, but do not forsake other means for checking your position.

    Remember that AstroNavigation has its limitations, as do programmers.

	HELP

	You will have to use the on-line help - ie press F1 at a menu.
	The help available is minimal.

	If you have not got a Sextant and want to try the sight-reduction
	routines. Then
	(a)   Find out what is visible in a certain place at a certain
	time using option ( Visible Bodies ) , and printing one page of
	output.
	(b) Using this data take a fix ( Taking a Fix ).
	(c) View the result ( Visible Bodies ) and see the Position lines
	on a Map ( Press M at the graphics menu ).
	(d) Use the Re-work sight option to remove appalling fixes
	 and re-view the result.

	There are lots of hidden (but nice) features that will only
	become apparent with use.

  ACCURACY :
       The data on the Sun is accurate to 0ø.01 and 0.1 mins
       between 1950 and 2050.
       The data on the Moon is accurate to 0ø.3 between 1950 and 2050.
       The value for GHA Aries is accurate.
       The Positions of the Navigational stars are accurate to 4
       minutes of degree over the period 1991-1995 and probably
       have similar accuracy up to 2000.
       The Positions of the other stars are accurate to minutes of
       degree probably over the period 1980 - 2000, except for
       those with large Declinations eg Polaris.
       The Planetary data is only designed to be accurate for 1990,
       but may be reasonably accurate over 5 years ? Accuracy in
       fractions of a degree.

       DO NOT RELY ON THIS PROGRAM. YOU MUST BE ABLE TO USE A NAUTICAL
       ALMANAC, AND CHECK IF THERE IS ANY DOUBT. THE POSITIONS FOR THE
       SUN AND NAVIGATIONAL STARS ARE PROBABLY ACCURATE ENOUGH OVER THE
       PERIOD 1991 - 1995. YOU CAN ALWAYS ENTER THE ALMANAC DATA INTO THE
       PROGRAM.

  INPUT :
	Much improved on version 1.4

	Dates are dd/mm/yy ie British system

	All angles are in degrees.
	Input will accept decimal degrees as well as
	degrees and minutes.
	+ and - are converted on input to N and S etc

	There are default values for latitude and longitude
	These change if you change them.

	Default values for date and time are taken from the
	system clock. The time is converted to approximate UT.
	The program works in UT ( universal time ).

	There are various units for length.



.

  OUTPUT :
       Many results can be printed or added to a file. Files will
       either be overwritten or added to as you request.

   MONITORS :
       Only tested on CGA,Hercules,EGA,VGA screens so far. The graphics
       may not work on other monitors. If they do/do not I would
       be interested in knowing.

  FIXES :
       Allows upto about 20 sights per fix.

  PRINTER :
       Will test for presence of printer.

  BUGS :
       There are still lots of bugs. The program may halt with a
       cryptic debug message. If so please send me the details.
       Polar sights may cause the program to terminate. The program
       gets sick at the poles.

.

	UPDATE

       This program supercedes NAUT_V1.EXE & NAUT102.EXE
			       NAUT103?.EXE & NAUT104?.EXE
	      please delete the old versions.

   IMPROVEMENTS on version 1.4
	Improved input routines
	Coastal outline
	List of places
	Constellation outlines
	Updated Almanac data
	Updated Planetary data
	Measurement unit conversion
	Timezone check
	Automatic installation



   NB the planetary data will not be suitable for anything other than
   identification purposes.
.

    FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
	Tightening up of routines for increased speed
	Possibly higher resolution coastline (speed and size probs)
	Possibly use of overlays
	Orbital elements for planets
	Improved star reduction formulae
	Confidence ellipse for position
	Improved graphics menu
	Improved online help
	Logging of input and output
	User configuration of program
