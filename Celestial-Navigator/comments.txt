I am very impressed by the possibilities of this program and like to
use it during my transatlantic sailing trip later this year.

About ten years ago when I got out of the Navy (US), I taught a course
on Celestial Navigation at the University....Perhaps I will revive this
course and supplement it with your program...

I was lucky enough to get hold of your navigation program and I just
love it....We have been using it in our navigation classes...

One thing that has impressed us shipboard is the graphics display of
the stars...As a stand alone Star Identifier we reckon it would be
a hot seller for you amongst merchant marine navigators.
I have..seen quite a few navigation programs...could become a good
seller to professional navigators...from Officer in Merchant Navy
with some 37 years at sea as a navigator on both merchant and RN
ships.
