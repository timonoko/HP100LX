Subject: Full Dos Launcher and Menu-switcher for HP*LX


LAUNCH.COM is an utility which allows you to launch 640k
dos-applications from HP100LX's application manager. This
is accomplished by completely terminating the application manager and
feeding approriate command line to the underlying dos-system.
This dos-application should be primarily a BAT-file, which when
terminated with 100-command will automatically restart the
application manager.

For example assuming that we have a c:\BAT\TEST.BAT-file containing
these 2 lines:
	CHKDSK
	100

and adding new icon: 
	Name: CHKDSK
	Path: C:\BAT\LAUNCH.COM TEST
	Comment: <Nothing here - especially not the reversed ?>

and now we can launch CHKDSK in 640k dos-space from the application
manager like any other smaller Dos-application previously.

** Note that LAUNCH can transport only 8 characters + <enter>
to the dos-system. LAUNCH.COM and those BAT-files that are
to be launched should be in the same directory. 

LAUNCH.COM is exellent for those huge two-way interactive language
translators (by ENTENTE) - just add "100" to the end of the BAT-files.


2. Menu-switcher
----------------

The enclosed MENU.BAT is launched with LAUNCH.COM.
MENU.BAT replaces C:\_DAT\APPMGR.DAT and some associated
files and thus accomplishes way to extend application manager's
icon capacity. I suggest that you study the MENU.BAT yourself to
understand its working. The basic usage of menu-swichers
would be like

Name: NEXT MENU
Path: C:\BAT\LAUNCH.COM MENU <this-menu-nmbr) <next-menu-nmbr>

For example MENU 0 2 would rename APPMGR.DAT into APPMGR.MN0
and then rename APPMGR.MN2 into APPMGR.DAT and thus when the
application manager is restarted, menu-0 is replaced with menu-2.

To create new menu (eg 7) inside some other menu (eg 3) you simply
write LAUNCH.COM MENU 3 7 -icon and activate that icon. If you
copy some other APPMGR-file into APPMGR.MN7 and use that to build new
menu, you must remember to change all menu-switching commands so that
they actually jump out from that particular menu-7, otherwise your
fancy multi-menu system will be hopelessly messed up!
I suggest reserving number-keys as short-cut-keys when selecting
corresponding menues. 

I assume that this stuff is not particularly HP100LX-dependant
and the above-mentioned and SWAP.BAT can be upgraded
simply by replacing the 100-commands with 200-commands.
